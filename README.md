The IPFS project has an ongoing, long-running ambition to **create visual and interaction standards and patterns for working with IPFS that are ...**

- **Simple**: Present the big ideas of IPFS clearly, without unnecessary complexity
- **Accessible**: Enable *everyone* to take advantage of what IPFS offers
- **Reusable**: Offer compelling standards and atomic patterns to the community of IPFS builders
- **Beautiful**: By their nature, things that are simple, accessible and reusable are also beautiful

## IPFS GUI projects

### Primary projects

At present, primary focus is on the three "helper" apps that provide a GUI for IPFS as a whole, in order to make them useful for seasoned IPFS developers while also offering a welcoming introduction to IPFS for those less experienced.

## Get involved!

### Contribute to an issue

Contributions to IPFS GUIs are more than welcome! Each of the repos listed under ["All projects"](#all-projects) above makes use of the IPFS Project's [global issue labeling scheme](https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/ISSUE_LABELS.md). Good labels to look for are ...
- `help wanted`
- `good first issue`
- and there are even occasional `bounty` labels for issues with rewards as part of the [IPFS Bounty Board](https://github.com/ipfs/devgrants/projects/1)!

If you see an issue that catches your eye, leave a comment so we know you're interested, and we'll go from there!

We're an open project and a friendly group, so please be nice and **read the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING_JS.md)** when you're ready to jump in.

### Discuss in GitHub or chat

**For the sake of async communication, archiving, and searchability, we strongly encourage discussions to happen in the context of GitHub issue comments whenever practical.**

For casual conversation, our official chat rooms in [Matrix](https://app.element.io/#/room/#lobby:ipfs.io) and [Discord](https://discord.gg/Z4H6tdECb9) are bridged, so you can join whichever you prefer. They can be used to ask questions and discuss with the community — however, while IPFS core developers are usually in these rooms, it can be hard to keep up with the running conversation and questions can be missed or disappear due to a lack of indexing.

## Support goals

### Platforms

Due to the difficulty involved in debugging and development on platforms and versions not supported by github actions (and our CI/CD tests), we can only provide support for the [top 3 (mac, windows, ubuntu) `latest` platforms supported by github](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#supported-runners-and-hardware-resources). 

If there is a new platform release, we will support bug-fixes and feature enhancements for that new platform, but will prioritize bug-fixes for things we can automate (CI/CD supported bugs/features).

### Languages

Due to a large demand and lack of time, as a general rule, we aim to support the latest (or most popular) officially supported versions of languages. 

#### NodeJS

> Production applications should only use Active LTS or Maintenance LTS releases.

See https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/ for the officially supported NodeJS Versions. We aim to support Active LTS or Maintenance LTS versions with a best-effort support for Current versions.

Support priority:

1. Active LTS
2. Maintenance LTS
