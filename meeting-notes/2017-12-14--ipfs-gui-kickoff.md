## Notes:

- WebComponent'izing is a secondary objective to this project
- Finding the IPFS GUI Styleguide and Language is the top priority
- We need to define the User Journey through the UIs of IPFS
- Right now WebUI feels like an external thing that no one owns or that anyone can rely on
- WebUI should support deep/parametrized permalinks
